# heartlab-weather-tracker
Small webapp to aid strategic administration of heartworm medication.

Heartworm pills can be administered strategically based on the temperatures and times at which the larvae can survive, saving a large amount of money in both medication and ham to wrap it in. This tool helps track local temperatures and provides a recommendation for when to start medication based on past temperatures and current forecast, as well as a cautiousness value entered by the user.

This tool is not and cannot be 100% reliable, is not a subsitute for veterinary knowledge, and is offered with no guarantee of safety. If you have questions or concerns about your pet, ask a qualified professional, not some guy on the internet.
